# :earth_africa: Country Information Fetching Application
A Python command line input application that allows users to search for country information or filter certain sets of countries by category such as name, region, subregion, languages, or currency. The API that this application pulls information from is the REST Countries API (https://restcountries.com/).

## Features

-  Search by Country Name: 
    Obtain detailed information for a specific country that includes:
      1) country's name
      2) capital
      3) region
      4) subregion
      5) population
      6) languages
      7) currencies
      8) nature of their independence.
     
      

  ### Filtering Countries By:
    - Region    (e.g. Europe, Africa, Americas)
    - Subregion (e.g. North America, Southern Europe, Southern Africa)
    - Language (e.g. English, Spanish)
    - Currency (e.g. USD, Peso, Yen, Pound)
  - Each Filter returns all matching countries and displays their country name, capital, and population
  
  ### The Interactive Loop
  -  ***The application will run continuously until the user types "exit" or "quit" notifying the system that they have concluded their search session.***
  
  -  This allows users to view and/or compare numerous datasets within a single session.

  ## Requirements
  
    - The user must have access to Python Version 3.8+
    - Stable Internet Connection
    - Python's "requests" library 
  ## Install Dependencies

  ## How to Run

  ## Usage
  ### Main Menu
    How would you like to access the Country data: Through Search or Filter?

    Population: 67391582
    Languages: {'fra': 'French'}
    Currencies: {'EUR': {'name': 'Euro', 'symbol': '€'}}

However if filter is entered then the next step would favor this example:

    Which category would you like to filter by: Region, Subregion, Language, or Currency?
    region              (input)
    
    Enter the desired region:
    europe        (input)
